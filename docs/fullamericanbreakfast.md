## Steps

1. Gather your ingredients and cooking necessities:

        a. The pan you will use is always on top of the stove.

        b. The eggs and bacon strips are in the fridge.

        c. Frozen hash browns can be found in the freezer, atop the fridge.

        d. Salt and Pepper and Bread can be found in the top cabinet of the
        pantry cabinet.

2. Cook the bacon in a pan on medium-high heat until crispy and
    browned. (See Figure 2 for color reference).

3. Place the bacon to the side, leaving the left-over bacon grease in
    the pan.

4. With the bacon grease still in the pan, crack the two eggs into the
    pan.

5. Cook the eggs on medium heat and flip the eggs over after a couple
    of minutes.

6. Once the eggs are cooked fully, season them with salt and pepper to
    taste.

7. Set the eggs aside with the bacon.

8. Leave the pan on medium heat to warm up the remaining bacon grease.

9. While the pan heats, place the slice of Wonder bread into the
    toaster oven and leave it to toast to a level of your choosing.

10. When the pan is heated, place the desired serving of frozen shredded
    hash browns in the pan.  
    > Do not layer them too high and make sure to
    evenly distribute them in the pan. It is okay to have some
    overlapping, but the hash browns should not be more than about a
    quarter of an inch thick.

11. Cook the shredded hash browns on one side for 5 minutes, or until
    the bottom is golden brown.

12. Flip the hash browns over and cook for an additional 3 minutes.

13. Add salt and pepper to taste.

14. Finally, plate the hash browns alongside the eggs and bacon, and
    retrieve your perfectly toasted slice of bread from the toaster.

15. **Enjoy!**
