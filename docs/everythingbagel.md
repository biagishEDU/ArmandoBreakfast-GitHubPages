# Everything Bagel with the Works

## Description

Have you ever had a bagel and thought\... "*This would be even better as
a sandwich!"*  Well, you are in luck! I will present to you the perfect
bagel sandwich recipe. With years of careful research and many a tragic
failure, I have discovered the ultimate, undefeated champion of the
bagel sandwich kingdom*.* An everything bagel with a maple syrup sausage
patty, fried egg, Chick-fil-A sauce drizzle, and *TWO* types of cheese
is all you need to begin your ultra-productive day as a sentient
caricature of this big floating rock we call Earth.

## Ingredients and Appliances

- Medium sized pan
- Stove
- Toaster-Oven
- 1 Pre-Sliced Everything Bagel
- 1 Egg
- 1 Maple Syrup Sausage Patty
- Chick-fil-A Sauce
- Chive and Onion Cream Cheese Spread
- 1 Slice Sharp Cheddar

### Steps

1. Gather your ingredients and cooking necessities:

        a.  A cast iron pan is always atop the stove.

        b.  The Toaster-Oven is to the left of the kitchen sink.

        c.  Bagels can be found in the cabinet pantry's middle cabinet.

        d.  Eggs, Cream Cheese, Cheddar Cheese slices, Sausage, and
        Chick-fil-A sauce can be found in the fridge. (Note that the
        Chick-fil-A sauce is in a bottle. See figure 2 for reference.)

2. Heat the pan to medium-high heat.

3. While the pan heats, place the bagel in the toaster-oven on the
    medium toasting setting.

4. Cook the sausage patty in the pan for 3 minutes.

5. Flip the patty and cook for an additional three minutes.

6. Now, the meat should no longer be pink, and the patty's outside
    should be brown and a bit crispy. Refer to the figure below for how
    the patty should look.

7. Place the sausage patty aside.

8. With grease still in the pan, crack the one egg into the pan.

9. Cook the egg on medium heat and flip over after a couple of minutes
    (3-4 minutes).

10. Cook for an additional 2 minutes, or until the egg has been cooked
    through.

11. Once the egg is cooked fully, season with salt and pepper to taste.

12. Set the egg aside with the sausage.

13. Now we can begin assembling the sandwich. Start by retrieving your
    bagel from the toaster.

14. On the bottom slice of the bagel, spread the Chive and Onion Cream
    Cheese evenly.

15. Next, place the egg atop the cream cheese.

16. On top of the egg, place a slice of cheddar cheese.

17. Place the sausage patty atop the slice of cheese.

18. Finally, top it all off with a drizzle of the Chick-fil-A sauce.

19. Place the top slice of the bagel on top and **enjoy!**
