## Steps

1. Gather ingredients and cooking necessities:

        a.  Pan is on top of the stove.

        b.  Pan lids can be found in the rightmost cabinet beneath the
        stove.

        c.  Tofu, Kale, red onion, and red pepper can be found in the
        fridge.

        d.  Olive Oil is to the left of the stove.

        e.  Salt, Garlic Powder, and Chili Powder can be found in the
        cabinet pantry's top cabinet.

        f.  Filtered water comes from the rightmost tap on the sink

        g.  Paper towers are on top of the counter.

        h.  Plates can be found in many of the cabinets above the stove.

        i.  Knives can also be found to the left of the stove.

        j.  Cooking utensils (spatula, spoons, etc.) are stored in the
        rightmost drawer beneath the stove.

        k.  Forks are on the dining table.

2. Remove tofu from packaging and pat dry with a paper towel.

3. Roll the tofu in a new paper towel and place a heavy plate on it.
    Leave it for 15 minutes.

4. In the meantime, prepare the sauce. Add the salt, garlic powder, and
    chili powder, with enough water to make the sauce pourable. If you
    want a thicker sauce, add less water. If you want a thinner sauce,
    add more water.

5. Set the sauce aside.

6. Prepare the veggies:

        a.  Thinly slice the red onion.

        b.  Thinly slice the red pepper.

        c.  Loosely chop the kale.

7. Place the pan on medium heat.

8. Once the pan is hot, add olive oil, sliced red onion, and sliced red
    pepper.

9. Season the veggies with a dash of salt and pepper.

10. Stir the veggies and cook until they have softened. This should take
    about 5 minutes.

11. Add kale to the pan and season again with a pinch of salt and
    pepper.

12. Cover the pan with the lid and let the mixture steam for 2 minutes.

13. While it steams, use a fork to crumble the tofu into bite-sized
    pieces.

14. After 2 minutes, using a spatula, move the veggie mixture to one
    side of the pan and add tofu to the other side. (See Figure 2 for
    reference).

    little over the vegetable mixture. (See Figure 3 for details).
